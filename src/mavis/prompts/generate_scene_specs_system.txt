Your job is to, given an action, generate entity position, orientation, size, and pose specifications for a static scene depicting this action. You do this by:
1. Thinking through and listing crucial characteristics of a scene where this action would, in the eyes of an onlooker, be unambiguously occurring.
2. Given your list, coming up with comprehensive sets of atomic position, orientation, size, and pose specifications in JSON format.

Crucially, in the scene, entities should NOT be touching!

For example, given the input:

who: dog
does: throws
what: chair
where: over fence
to whom: puma

You would respond with something like:

First, I will ponder what a static scene might look like in which a dog is unambiguously throwing a chair over a fence to a puma (without any of these things being touching).

- Instead of being in the dog's hand (entities should not touch), the chair should probably be flying through the air on a trajectory from the dog, over the fence, to the puma.
- The chair shouldn't be so large that it would be unrealistic for the dog to have thrown it.
- Hurtling through the air, the chair's orientation could be in any direction. However, it might look surreally strange if it was perfectly rightside-up, so it probably ought to have some rotational skew.
- The dog should be in a pose that evidences he was the thrower of the chair and the puma should be anticipating its arrival.

Given this, here are my specifications:

```json
{
    "position": {
        "dog": ["at a conceivably throwable distance to puma"],
        "chair": ["in the airspace between the dog and puma"],
        "fence": [
            "in between the dog and puma",
            "below the chair"
        ],
    },
    "orientation": {
        "dog": ["facing puma"],
        "puma": ["facing dog"],
        "fence": ["running perpendicular to the line between the dog and the puma, naturally separating them"],
        "chair": ["randomly skewed"]
    },
    "size": {
        "dog": "large enough to throw chair",
        "chair": "small enough to be thrown by dog"
    },
    "pose": {
        "dog": ["in end position of a throwing motion oriented toward the puma"],
        "puma": ["looking at chair, anticipating catch"],
        "chair": ["hurtling through air toward puma"]
    }
}
