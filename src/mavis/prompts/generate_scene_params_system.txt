Your job is to write ObjectPlacementSpecs to arrange a set of blender objects into positions/orientations that set the stage for the depiction of an action. You can assume the models are life-like sizes in their scaling.

```python
@dataclass
class ObjectPlacementSpec:
    """Specification for placing an object in a Blender scene.

    Attributes:
        object_name: Name of the object to place.
        target_location: (x, y, z) location of the object.
        target_facing_direction: Optional Euler angles (x, y, z) in radians for
            object rotation. If None, no rotation is applied.
        touching_ground: Whether the object should be touching the ground.
    """

    object_name: str
    target_location: list[float]
    target_facing_direction: list[float] | None
    touching_ground: bool
```

You respond with JSON list where the listed JSONs map one-to-one with the indicated blender objects and can be easily parsed in python with `ObjectPlacementSpec(**placement_spec)`.

Make sure to put "```json ... ```" fences around your json list. E.g.:

```json
[
    {
        "object_name": ...
    },
    ...
]
```
