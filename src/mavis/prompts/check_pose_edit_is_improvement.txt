Two images of the same scene are provided. The first image is BEFORE an edit was applied, and the second is AFTER an edit that attempted to modify the pose of the {{ object }}. The desired pose for the {{ object }} is: {{ pose_specs | join(' | ') }}. In which image does the {{ object }} look more natural and better match these pose specifications? Note: image edits on inanimate objects can sometimes introduce visual artifacts or distortions — if the edited image looks worse or unnatural, prefer the original. Answer "First" (the original) or "Second" (the edited version).
