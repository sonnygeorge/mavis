Modify ONLY the physical state or pose of the EXISTING {{ object }} (whose location is given in the mask) to be as follows while keeping everything else the exact same. Make sure to: (1) keep the {{ object }}'s EXACT SAME size and proportions as in the source image and (2) maintain its relative position w.r.t. other things (you can move it marginally as needed). The physical state/pose of the {{ object }} should be: {{ pose_specs | join(' | ') }}. DO NOT introduce anything new to the image.
