# MAVIS

Multi-view Action-to-Visual Image Synthesis

## Dev Notes:

- Currently launching created scene with `"/Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender" test_output.blend`

### TODO

- Rest of pipeline
- "walk" the percentiles of the POV sampling distribution if diverse POVS is important
- Soft "blacklist" regions in POV sampling distribution when object overlap is computed if efficiency is important
